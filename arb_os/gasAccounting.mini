//     run non-mutating calls on a private clone of the chain, so that it can get
//     correct results from those non-mutating calls without having to use the more
//     expensive public protocol. To do this, a validator will make a private clone of the
//     chain's state, then "sideload" messages asking for the non-mutating calls into the
//     private clone.
// So in the private clone only, a validator can cause the sideload instruction to push
//     onto the stack a pair (message, gasLimit).  This function will then return that
//     pair, which will cause (the private clone of) the chain to run that call.
